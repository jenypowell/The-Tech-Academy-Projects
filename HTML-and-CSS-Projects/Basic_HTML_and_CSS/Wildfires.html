<h1>Oregon Wildfires</h1>


<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The wildfires have burned millions of acres in Oregon in 2020.<br>
We had to evacuate for 7 days but luckily we were able to come home!.<br>
There was ash falling all around us while we loaded up our pigs and ducks to bring them to a shelter.<br>
We used a volunteer group called Cowgirl 911&copy;	Who were amazing and I cannot thank them enough!</span></p>
